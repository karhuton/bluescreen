Bluescreen.live node web server

## Goals of the software

Bluescreen.live is a very simple screensharing service with the goal:
- optimize quality for presentations and text
- very very simple to use
- just plain http polling, so works on any network
- use very little resources
- should work on old devices, especially older TVs


## Example use cases:

1) Big screen in a meeting room
- direct your smart tv browser to the site
- it shows a rotating join code for anyone to share in the meeting

2) Share on my behalf
- one person can connect to the meeting room screen and use bluescreen
- others can simply share to their screen
- no switching HDMI cables or broadcast adapters

3) Screensharing without a Teams & al.
- share your screen to others from computer-to-computer
- no need to setup teams or other sharing system

4) Mobile screen sharing (doesn't work yet)
- when having an unofficial meeting outside company spaces
- use qr codes to share link


## Mobile screensharing doesn't work yet
